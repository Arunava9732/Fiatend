								<p>RISK WARNING DISCLOSURE<p>
								Virtual/crypto assets and their dealing come with a number of risks. You hereby indicate and guarantee that you have reviewed the following Virtual/Crypto Assets Risk Disclosures before accessing or using the Services.
								
								<p>Overview of virtual/crypto commodities –<p>
								Virtual/crypto assets have no intrinsic worth and are not recognised as legal tender in the majority of countries, including India. The agreement of the parties to a transaction, which may or may not be dependent on the market worth of the virtual/crypto asset at the moment of the transaction, determines the price of virtual/crypto assets.
								Since most nations do not have regulations governing investments in virtual or crypto-assets, you are not likely to be safeguarded if something goes awry. Additionally, the documentation released by the company that created the virtual/crypto-asset may not be entirely explicit about the risks involved with the purchase.
								
								<p>Market Rate Variations –<p>
								Virtual and crypto assets are extremely volatile because their prices are determined by how people consider them to be worth, as well as other elements that are beyond the power of any one entity.
								
								<p>Liquidity, valuation, and market influence-<p>
								Virtual/crypto-assets can be exchanged individually negotiated deals, through a wide range of virtual/crypto-asset exchanges, and through a number of middlemen worldwide, each with its own pricing model and/or order book. There are many valuation difficulties caused by the absence of a centralised pricing source. It may also affect values or availability that a small number of virtual/crypto assets are held in a highly concentrated manner.
								Thus, when purchasing or selling virtual or crypto-assets, you might not receive a reasonable price or treatment, or you might not be able to sell your virtual or crypto-assets as rapidly as you would like if there is no buyer. Furthermore, market players attempting to exit a stake may encounter difficulties due to the dispersed liquidity, especially during stressful times. There have been numerous reports of market fraud cases.
								
								<p>Cybersecurity-<p>
								Cybersecurity risks associated with virtual/crypto assets and related "wallets" or spot trades include hacking flaws and the possibility that openly disseminated ledgers may not be immutable. For market players who exchange virtual/crypto assets, a cyber-security incident could cause a sizable, instant, and irreversible loss. A virtual/crypto asset's price is likely to decline, possibly affecting other virtual/crypto commodities as well, if there is even a small cybersecurity incident.
								
								<p>Unidentified Spot Market Analysis-<p>
								Virtual/crypto asset amounts are usually stored as a block chain address that can be viewed using private keys, which may be kept by a custodian or a market player. On a blockchain or distributed ledger, virtual/cryptoasset activities are usually openly accessible, but the public address does not reveal the controller, proprietor, or user of the secret key.
								Virtual/crypto-asset exchanges and administrators that store virtual/crypto-assets do not always know who the proprietor is, in contrast to bank and brokerage accounts. The opaque underlying or spot market makes asset verification difficult for market participants, regulators, and auditors and increases the risk of manipulation and fraud, including the possibility of Ponzi schemes, bucket shops, and pump and dump schemes, which may erode market confidence in a virtual/crypto asset and have a negative impact on its price.
								
								<p>Intermediaries, administrators, and virtual/crypto asset exchanges-<p>
								Virtual/crypto asset exchanges are comparatively new and generally unregulated in most countries, as are other middlemen, custodians, and vendors used to enable virtual/crypto asset trades. The risk that a virtual/crypto-asset exchange may not hold enough virtual/crypto-assets and funds to fulfill its responsibilities and that such deficit may not be readily recognised or discovered is brought on by the hidden underlying spot market and the absence of regulatory supervision. Additionally, compared to controlled futures or stock exchanges, many virtual/crypto-asset exchanges have encountered major disruptions, downtime, transaction processing delays, flash breakdowns, and may have a greater degree of operational risk.
								Particularly in a cross-border setting where it may also be challenging to determine which laws may be applied, it may be difficult or even impossible to identify and/or find the issuer of virtual/crypto-asset, the trading platform, the wallet provider, or the intermediary. So, if a user has a claim, it might be challenging to bring legal action against the issuer or wallet service and establish ownership.
								
								<p>Administrative Setting-<p>
								Most virtual/crypto assets, as well as the marketing of goods or services associated with virtual/crypto assets, are unsupervised. In these circumstances, you will not be entitled to the rights and safeguards, such as protest or recourse procedures, that are accessible to customers of controlled financial services.
								The regulatory environment for virtual and cryptocurrency assets is presently ambiguous in many countries. Additionally, some foreign state securities authorities have issued warnings that many initial coin offerings are probably covered by their respective securities laws and will therefore likely come under the definition of a security. In the future, one or more states may pass laws, rules, or guidelines that have an impact on virtual/crypto asset networks and their users. The price of virtual/crypto assets and their adoption by users, retailers, and service providers may be impacted by such laws, rules, or orders.
								
								<p>Technology-<p>
								The technology that underpins virtual/crypto-assets is relatively new and is changing quickly, which adds specific risks. For instance, in order to view, use, or trade a virtual/cryptoasset on a block chain or distributed ledger, a distinct private key is necessary. A virtual/crypto object linked to a private key may experience an irrevocable loss if it is lost, stolen, or destroyed. Investors' capacity to engage in forks may have consequences as well. For instance, if a virtual/cryptoasset exchange forbids its clients from taking part in a fork that produces a new product, a market participant having a stake through the exchange may suffer.
								
								<p>Transaction Fees-<p>
								Many virtual/crypto assets enable traders to pay processors (i.e., parties that handle transactions and log them on a distributed database or blockchain) a fee. Although it is not required, a fee is typically required to guarantee that a transaction is quickly documented on a blockchain or distributed database. These costs' amounts are determined by market factors, and it is possible that they will rise significantly in a time of worry. Additionally, compared to caretakers in many other financial marketplaces, virtual/crypto asset exchanges, wallet providers, and other custodians may charge excessive costs.
								
								<p>Inadequate Details-<p>
								Any particular virtual or cryptocurrency asset's information could be absent, incorrect, lacking, or confusing in terms of the project and its risks. To comprehend the features of the virtual/crypto-asset and/or the project, you may need to have advanced knowledge and a thorough understanding of the documents. Some virtual/crypto assets and associated goods are aggressively marketed to the general public using marketing collateral and other information that may be ambiguous, lacking crucial details, unreliable, or even deliberately deceptive.
								
								<p>Fraud & Malicious Activities-<p>
								There are a lot of scams and false virtual/crypto assets out there, and you should be conscious that their only goal is to steal your money using various methods, like phishing or using a bogus ID. A significant amount of financial risk is involved when trading in digital payment tokens. Digital Payment Tokens might not be suitable for all buyers, so you should, if required, seek out fair guidance. Trading with digital payment tokens carries the risk of losing all of your money.
								Any fiat or virtual/crypto asset that is moved into a user account, wallet, or sub-account may be mixed with fiat or virtual/crypto asset belonging to other users or affiliated businesses.
								DISCLAIMER, LIABILITY & INDEMNIFICATION

								NOTHING IN THE APPLICATION AND SERVICES CAN BE GUARANTEED TO BE FREE OF MISTAKES, INACCURACIES, MISREPRESENTATIONS, FAILS, ETC. SUCH ERRORS, MISTAKES, MISREPRESENTATIONS, OR FAILS, ETC., MAY BE DUE IN WHOLE OR IN PART TO HUMAN ACTION, APPLICATION FLAWS, OR PROCESS FLAWS.

								<p>LIABILITY<p>
								In no event will Fiatend, its affiliates, and each of their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, or contractors be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, consequential, or similar damages or liabilities (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data, information, revenue, profits, or other businesses or financial benefit). The above limitation may not apply to you because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages.
								Despite the foregoing, Fiatend, its affiliates, and each of their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors will never be liable for services provided by or on behalf of Fiatend and its affiliates, for the performance or non-performance of Fiatend services, or for any other product, service, or item, whether under a contract, statute, strict liability, or other theory of liability, including, but not limited to, negligence.
								
								<p>INDEMNIFICATION<p>
								<p>You agree to defend Fiatend (and its officers, employees, and agents) against any claim or demand made by a third party resulting from or arising out of<p>
								
								<p> (a) your use of the Services,<p>
								
								<p> (b) your violation of this Agreement,<p>
								
								<p> (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations, or<p>
								
								<p> (d) Third-Party Services.<p>
								
								<p>This agreement also includes payment of Fiatend's costs and attorneys' fees. You agree to cooperate with Fiatend's defence of these claims. Fiatend retains the right to take the sole defence and control of any issue for which you are required to indemnify us at your cost. You concur to never resolve a dispute without Fiatend's previous written approval. When Fiatend becomes aware of any such claim, lawsuit, or proceeding, it will make reasonable attempts to inform you of it.<p>
								
								<p>TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT, SUSPENSION & CANCELLATIONS<p>
								<p>If Fiatend finds that you are breaking the Terms and Applicable Law, Fiatend retain the right to stop, block, reverse, or rescind a transaction and/or deny you access to the Online Platforms (even if money has already been deducted from your User Account).
								All remaining account balance (including charges and obligations due) after a User Account is closed, withdrawn, cancelled, or deactivated will be instantly payable to us, our companies, or associates. You will be given a fair amount of business days to withdraw all funds from the account following settlement of all outstanding costs to Us (if any). In the event that any account is suspended or closed due to scams, cyber investigations, investigations into possible violations of the law or violations of these Terms, we may continue to have complete possession of the money, digital assets, and user data/information.
								If any of the following occur, Fiatend has the right to immediately terminate these Terms by cancelling your Fiatend Account. Fiatend also has the right, but not the obligation, to permanently freeze (cancel) your Fiatend Account's authorizations on Fiatend and withdraw the relevant Fiatend Account:
								When these Terms are amended, you declare your refusal to accept the amended Terms by requesting cancellation of your Fiatend Account or by other means;
								when Fiatend terminates services to you;
								when you allegedly register or allegedly register as a Fiatend user again, directly or indirectly;
								when the information you have provided is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete;
								when Fiatend terminates services to you under any other circumstances.
								In the event that your Fiatend Account terminates, the account and transactional data that complies with data preservation guidelines will be safely kept for 5 years. Additionally, Fiatend shall have the right to inform your counterparty of the circumstance at that moment if a transaction cannot be completed during the account closure procedure. You recognise that the aforementioned termination procedure will also apply to a user-initiated account departure (right to erasure under GDPR or other comparable laws).<p>
								
								<p>GENERAL TERMS<p>
								<p>LEGAL RECOURSE IN CASE OF DISPUTE<p>
								We at Fiatend try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it’s useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
								The term "dispute resolution clause" designates the contractual terms by which parties define how their disputes are to be handled as a point of classification: this contains references to arbitration, and court-based lawsuits (commonly known as a "jurisdiction clause").
								
								<p>Arbitration<p>
								Arbitration - Please carefully read this section as it impacts your privileges and is a requirement of your agreement with Fiatend. It includes steps for required binding arbitration.
								
								<p>You and the Company, Fiatend agree to settle any claims relating to this agreement (including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination, any services or products provided, or any representations made by us) through final and binding arbitration in the event that the Company is involved in the dispute, controversy, or claim.
								Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period:
								Fiatend should be contacted first. If at all reasonable, Fiatend would like to resolve your issues without having to file an official lawsuit. Contact Fiatend if you have a problem with them, and a complaint number will be given to you. Fiatend will make an immediate effort to settle your disagreement privately. The parties concur to engage in good faith negotiations to settle the disagreement. (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).
								By reaching us via our website, mobile application, or PC application, you consent to first giving us the chance to address any allegations. You may pursue redress through arbitration in line with the arbitration provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, which are considered to be inserted into these Terms by reference, if we are unable to settle your claims within 60 days of receiving the notification.
								“ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR DIFFERENCE RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO THE ARBITRATION, OF A SOLE ARBITRATOR.  THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1996 AS MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME.  THE KANPUR ARBITRATION CENTRE, WILL APPOINT THE SOLE ARBITRATOR AND WILL CONDUCT THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS RULES FOR CONDUCT OF ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS THEN IN FORCE AND APPLICABLE TO THE PROCEEDING.  THE SEAT AND VENUE OF ARBITRATION SHALL BE KANPUR, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER CENTRES.  THE PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE UNDERTAKEN IN ENGLISH.  THE ARBITRATION AWARD SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON THE PARTIES”<p>
								 
								<p>The disputing parties will each bear their own costs of arbitration.
								Confidentiality - The entire arbitration process, including but not limited to the arbitrator's ruling and adherence to it, must be kept absolutely confidential. Unless otherwise compelled by law, the parties agree to preserve secrecy. This clause shall not restrict a party from providing information to a court of law that is required for the enforcement of this agreement, the enforcement of an arbitration decision, or the pursuit of remedial or equitable relief.
								Severability - This Arbitration Agreement's specific parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any part or parts of the Agreement to be unlawful or unenforceable. The remaining portions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
								Even if your partnership with Fiatend ends, this arbitration agreement will remain in effect.<p>
								 
								<p>Governing Law - The statutes of the Republic of India shall apply to these Terms.<p>
								 
								<p>Waiver of Trial/Legal Proceedings<p>
								The parties agree that all claims and disputes will be settled through arbitration in accordance with this terms-of-service agreement's arbitration provision, and they hereby renounce their right to appear in court and have a trial in front of a judge or court, as appropriate. Arbitration rules tend to be limited, more effective, and less expensive than court rules, and they are only very rarely subject to judicial review.
								
								<p>Assignment<p>
								Any attempt by you to assign or transfer any right or obligation that has come to you under these Terms shall be invalid and unenforceable. You are not permitted to assign or transfer any such right or obligation. We may, in our sole discretion, and without any limitation to our companies, connected entities, or any other third party, delegate, novate, or transfer any or all of the rights and duties that have accumulated in our favour under these terms.
								
								<p>Force Majure <p> 
								In the event of a delay or failure to fulfill an obligation under this Agreement that is caused by a fire, strike, flood, power outage, act of God or an enemy of the state, a lawful public authority action, any and all market movements, shifts, or volatility, a computer, server, or Internet malfunction, a security breach or cyber-attack, criminal activity, a common carrier's delays or default, or an act of a third party, Fiatend shall not be liable for damages. In the case of a force majeure, Fiatend is released from all performance duties, and this Agreement will be completely and irrevocably terminated.
								
								<p>Digital Communications <p>
								Whether you use the Site or email us, or Fiatend publishes notices on the Site or contacts you via email, all interactions between you and Fiatend are done so online. For contractual purposes, you (a) agree to receive communications from Fiatend electronically; and (b) acknowledge and agree that all agreements, terms and conditions, notices, disclosures and other communications that Fiatend provides to you digitally satisfies any legal requirement that such communications be in a hardcopy writing. The aforementioned has no bearing on your non-waivable privileges.
								
								<p>Amendments<p>
								By updating this website, Fiatend reserves the right to change these Terms at any moment, with or without notification. We advise you to check this page occasionally to be aware of any updates because they will be legally binding on you. Your agreement to be bound by these Terms will be presumed if you continue to use the Services. We demand that you cease using the Online Platforms and Services right away if you disagree with any portion of these Terms or any changes thereto.
								
								<p>Entire Agreement<p>
								The terms of our entire arrangement with respect to your use of the Services are contained in this arrangement and Fiatend's Privacy Policy. There is no partnership or agent link between Fiatend and you; you work with them as an individual user. You are not permitted to assign, sublet, delegate, or otherwise transfer this Agreement or your rights and duties without Fiatend's prior written permission. Any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in breach of the aforesaid will be invalid. This Agreement is completely modifiable by Fiatend. Fiatend Users shall be subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.
